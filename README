# model*EAU* data filters

This repository contains:

- An object-oriented re-implementaiton of the Alferes univariate outlier detection algorithm
- An implementation of the Alferes kernel smoother for time series.


## How to run the code in this repo

### Software requirements

1. python >= 3.9.0

### Instructions

1. Install the poetry dependency manager for python by running the following command [see the poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

1. initialize a virtual environment by running the following command:

    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

1. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

    ```bash
    poetry init
    ```

1. Run the main script by using the following command:

    ```bash
    python ./src/data_filters/main.py
    ```

This should result in a graph showing in your web browser. If so, the package was installed successfully.

## Using the main script on your own data

The `main.py` file is the entry point for the project. Running it will filter a sample set of data. To run it, from the root directory of the repo, run the following command:

```bash
python ./src/data_filters/main.py --file /path/to/source/data/file.csv
````

Additional arguments can be added at the end of this command to modify the behavior of the script:

`--index`: Used to indicate which column of the csv file contains the index of the data. By default, the value is `0`.

`--config` : Used to point to the config file of your choice. By default, it will point to the config file at the root of this repo (which contains default values.

`--plot`: Indicates whether you want the script to output a plot of the results. Use with values `"true"` or `"false"`
